## Planning

What URLs do we want our application to have to simulate the feeling of different "pages"?

| Component       | Url                |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Home            | / (root route)     |
| About           | /about             |
| CreateProject     | /projects/new      |
| EditProject | /projects/:id/edit |
| ProjectDetail   | /projects/:id      |
| ProjectPage     | /projects          |
